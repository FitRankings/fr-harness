# FR Harness


This harness is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building applications, infrastructure, documentation, and more.


---



## Usage



At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .fr-harness "https://git.io/fr-harness"; echo .fr-harness)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.fr-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.fr-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...
1. `git clone https://github.com/fitrankings/fr-farness.git` to pull down the repository
