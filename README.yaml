    # Short description of this project
    description: |-
        This harness is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building applications, infrastructure, documentation, and more.
    
    # How to use this project
    usage: |-
        At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

        ```make
        -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .fr-harness "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FitRankings/fr-harness/master/templates/Makefile.fr-harness?token=AECXTXGG7XNNZ5I56FWTYB26HNQPM"; echo .fr-harness)
        ```

        This will download a `Makefile` called `.fr-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.fr-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.
        
        This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.
        
        Run `make help` for a list of available targets.
        
        **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names
